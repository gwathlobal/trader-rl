== Compiling ==

You need:
* SBCL or CLISP
* cl-store
* lispbuilder-sdl

Both cl-store and lispbuilder-sdl can be installed via quicklisp.

Start your Common Lisp interpreter and execute:
 
(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :trader-rl)

Once everything is loaded, execute:

(trader-rl:make-exec)

This will create an executable with the name "trader-rl".

Windows users need to rename it to "trader-rl.exe" and they are good to go.

== Distribution ==

To distribute the game, you need the following files placed to the directory where the executable is located:
* SDL.dll
* zlib1.dll
